This example demonstrates what the quiz would look like without boxes around the questions.

Key design changes:
1. Removed the background and border from the question area
2. Made the question text white with text shadow for readability
3. Increased contrast by using darker shadows on the question text
4. Kept the option buttons boxed for readability and interactivity
5. The image container still has a background to make the images visible

This design allows the background gallery images to be more visible throughout the quiz
while maintaining readability of the quiz content.
